<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-Fungal Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Azoles</li><li>Polyenes</li><li>5-fluorocytosine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anti-fungal agents market is primarily segmented into three types: Azoles, Polyenes, and 5-fluorocytosine. Azoles, including drugs like ketoconazole, inhibit fungal cell membrane synthesis, making them pivotal for treating various infections. Polyenes, such as amphotericin B, disrupt fungal cell membrane integrity, effectively targeting severe fungal infections. 5-fluorocytosine is a nucleoside analogue that interferes with fungal RNA and protein synthesis, used mainly in combination therapies for systemic fungal infections. Each type plays a vital role in combatting fungal diseases.</p></p>
