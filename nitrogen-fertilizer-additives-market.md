<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nitrogen Fertilizer Additives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Urease Inhibitors Based Nitrogen Fertilizer Additives</li><li>Nitrification Inhibitor Based Nitrogen Fertilizer Additives</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The nitrogen fertilizer additives market comprises primarily urease inhibitors and nitrification inhibitors. Urease inhibitor-based additives slow down the breakdown of urea into ammonia, reducing nitrogen loss through volatilization, thereby enhancing nutrient availability. Nitrification inhibitor-based additives impede the conversion of ammonia to nitrates, minimizing nitrogen leaching and denitrification. Both types aim to increase nitrogen use efficiency in agricultural practices, improve crop yields, and support environmental sustainability by reducing nitrogen runoff and greenhouse gas emissions.</p></p>
